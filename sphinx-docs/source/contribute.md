# Contribute

**Hrv-analysis** is an Open Source project and there are still improvements to make.

All contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements and new ideas are welcome.

If you are simply looking to start working with the **hrv-analysis** codebase, navigate to the GitHub “issues” tab and start looking through interesting issues.

You can also triage issues which may include reproducing bug reports, or asking for vital information such as version numbers or reproduction instructions.

Or maybe through using **hrv-analysis** you have an idea of your own or are looking for something in the documentation and thinking ‘this can be improved’...you can do something about it!
